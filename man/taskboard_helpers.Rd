\value{
Function to be passed as \code{in_progress_when} argument in \code{viz_taskboard()}
}
\description{
The \code{viz_taskboard()} function creates a three-column layout of entities that are
not started, in progress, or done. Objects are classified as done when they have a
\code{state} of "closed". Object are classified as "To-Do" when they are neither "Closed"
or "In Progress". However, what constistutes "In Progress" is user and project dependent.
Thus, these functions let users specify what they mean.
